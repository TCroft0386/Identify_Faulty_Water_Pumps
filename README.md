Water Pump Challenge 
Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, can you predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all? Predict one of these three classes based on a number of variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed. A smart understanding of which water pumps will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.

This predictive modeling challenge comes from DrivenData, an organization that helps non-profits by hosting data science competitions for social impact. The competition has open licensing: "The data is available for use outside of DrivenData." We are reusing the data on Kaggle's InClass platform so we can run a weeklong challenge just for your Lambda School Data Science cohort.

The data comes from the Taarifa waterpoints dashboard, which aggregates data from the Tanzania Ministry of Water. In their own words:
